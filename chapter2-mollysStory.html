		<h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
		<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
		<p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about and hour now.  On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other scientific jounals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>.  It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four wals the more she felt she needed to be free. </p>
		<p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster witha n Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>.  Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of teh llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>
